6. Difference Between statically typed and Dynamically typed Programming language
- Statically Type Programming Language is one in which the variable is known at compile time, meaning that all the details about the variables and all the data types must be known before any compiling process is done.
Examples are: Java, C, C++, C#, Swift, Scala, Kotlin, Fortran, Pascal, Rust, Go, COBOL
- Dynamically Typed Programming Language is one in which the variable is checked during run time. Here, there is no need to specify the data type of each variable while writing the code.  
Examples are: Python, Javascript, Ruby, Pearl, PHP, R, Dart, Lua, Objective-C, e.t.c.

7. Differentiate between Null and Undefined
- Null indicates the absence of a value for a variable.
- Undefined indicates the absence of the variable itself.
